# 🛡️ The Architect's Forge: Backend Odyssey

Welcome to the **Architect's Forge**, a high-performance, resilient backend template powered by .NET 9 and built with Clean Architecture. 

This project is currently in its **Refactoring Phase**. All integration tests pass (100% success rate). Recent improvements include:
* OTP Strategy Pattern for device, registration, and password reset flows
* Thread-safe SMTP email sending (per-request SmtpClient)
* Device idempotency and constraint handling
* Multi-layered security: DoS protection, rate limiting, idempotency, JWT rotation
* Documentation overhaul for new features and security

## 🚀 Project Overview

The forge is designed to provide a robust starting point for modern web applications. It implements core features with a heavy emphasis on reliability and idempotency:

*   **🔐 Dual-Layer Authentication:** Integrated support for both internal (Email/Password) and external (Google OAuth2) authentication schemes.
*   **🛡️ Strong Idempotency:** Custom action filters powered by Redis ensure that critical requests (like registration or updates) are resilient to network failures and accidental retries.
*   **👤 User Management:** Full profile management systems including phone and address updates, email verification, and password recovery.
*   **🤝 Guest Accommodation:** Support for anonymous guest sessions that can be seamlessly promoted to full accounts or linked to Google OAuth2.
*   **👁️ Total Observability:** Detailed structured logging across all services and middlewares, integrated with Seq for real-time analysis.
*   **🧪 Absolute Integration:** A suite of 60+ integration tests that spin up real infrastructure (Postgres, Redis, RabbitMQ) to guarantee system integrity.

## ⚡ Power Grid (Technology Stack)

The Forge utilizes a sophisticated network of modern tools and frameworks:

### **Core Stack**
*   **.NET 9 (C#):** The latest high-performance framework from Microsoft.
*   **Entity Framework Core:** EF Core 9 with Npgsql for PostgreSQL interactions.
*   **PostgreSQL:** The primary relational database for persistent storage.
*   **Redis:** High-speed distributed cache for session management and idempotency locking.
*   **RabbitMQ & MassTransit:** Enterprise-grade service bus for asynchronous event processing.

### **Security & Identity**
*   **JWT Bearer:** Standardized token-based authentication.
*   **Google OAuth2:** External login integration.
*   **BCrypt.Net:** Industrial-strength password hashing.
*   **Asp.Versioning:** Semantic API versioning.

### **Application Logic**
*   **FluentValidation:** Expressive validation for incoming DTOs.
*   **Mapster:** High-performance object mapping.
*   **Serilog:** Structured logging with sinks for Console, File, and Seq.
*   **FluentEmail:** Elegant email composition and delivery through SMTP.

### **Testing & Quality**
*   **xUnit:** Leading .NET testing framework.
*   **Testcontainers:** Docker orchestration during test runs for real-world simulation.
*   **Respawn:** Database cleanup between test scenarios.
*   **MailHog:** Local SMTP testing server for email verification flows.

## 🛠️ Leveling Up (Getting Started)

1.  **Summon the Artifacts:**
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```
2.  **Ignite the Engine:**
    ```bash
    dotnet run --project Src/API
    ```
    Open `MyBackendTemplate.sln` in VS Code or Visual Studio.
3.  **Inspect the Chronicles:**
    Visit `http://localhost:8081` to view your realm's heartbeats in Seq.
    Visit `http://localhost:15672` for RabbitMQ management (guest/guest).
4.  **Enter the Admin Chambers:**
    Visit `http://localhost:15672` to manage the RabbitMQ Messenger Guild (guest/guest).

## 📐 Architecture & Design

This project follows **Clean Architecture** principles with strict dependency flow inward toward the domain layer:

```
API (Controllers, Middleware) 
  ↓ depends on
Application (Services, DTOs, Validators) 
  ↓ depends on
Domain (Entities, Business Rules)
  ↑ implemented by
Infrastructure (Repositories, DbContext)
```

### Key Architectural Patterns:
- **Result Pattern:** Explicit error handling without exceptions for expected failures
- **Repository Pattern:** Data access abstraction with EF Core implementation
- **Dependency Injection Facade:** Clean, organized service registration per layer
- **Idempotency Filter:** Redis-backed request deduplication for critical operations
- **Extension Methods:** Reusable controller logic (user ID extraction, cookie management)

### Code Quality & Security:
- **140 Integration Tests** with Testcontainers (100% pass rate)
- **OTP Strategy Pattern:** Device, registration, and password reset flows use pluggable OTP strategies
- **Thread-safe SMTP:** Scoped SmtpClient for concurrent email sending
- **Device Idempotency:** Prevents duplicate device errors in login flows
- **OAuth2 Testing Sandbox:** Local HTML testers in `test_oauth/` for validating social login and guest promotion flows
- **Multi-layered DoS Protection:** Kestrel limits, rate limiting, request size constraints
- **Structured Logging:** Serilog with Seq integration for observability
- **Environment Variable Validation:** Fail-fast startup with consolidated error reporting
- **JWT Authentication:** Stateless, horizontally scalable auth with refresh token rotation
